# Operating System (OS)

## Definition

An **Operating System (OS)** is a software layer that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides a set of services for computer programs. It acts as an intermediary between users and the computer hardware, making it easier to interact with and use computer resources efficiently.

The OS performs several critical functions, including process management, memory management, file management, and device management. It ensures that different applications and users can access hardware resources in a controlled and secure manner.

## Types of Operating Systems

### 1. **Batch Operating System**

- Processes jobs in batches without user interaction during processing.
- Jobs are collected, grouped, and processed sequentially.
- Example: Early IBM OS systems.

### 2. **Time-Sharing Operating System**

- Allows multiple users to share system resources simultaneously.
- Employs time slices to switch between users/processes, giving the impression of multitasking.
- Example: UNIX.

### 3. **Distributed Operating System**

- Manages a group of independent computers as a single system, providing distributed computing capabilities.
- Allows resources and processing to be shared across networked machines.
- Example: Google’s Borg system.

### 4. **Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)**

- Designed to process data as it comes in, with strict time constraints.
- Used in systems where timely processing is critical, such as embedded systems.
- Example: VxWorks, FreeRTOS.

### 5. **Network Operating System (NOS)**

- Provides networking capabilities like file sharing, printer access, and data exchange.
- Often used in environments where computers need to communicate and share resources.
- Example: Windows Server, Novell NetWare.

### 6. **Mobile Operating System**

- Specifically designed for mobile devices, optimized for touch inputs and mobile-specific hardware.
- Example: Android, iOS.

### 7. **Embedded Operating System**

- Used in specialized devices like ATMs, washing machines, and medical equipment.
- Usually, lightweight and dedicated to specific functions.
- Example: Embedded Linux, Windows Embedded.
