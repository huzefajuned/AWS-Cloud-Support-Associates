# 1. Operating System (OS)

- An operating system acts as an intermediary between the user of a computer and computer hardware.

- its an interface between computer hardware and user

- The OS performs several critical functions, including process management, memory management, file management, and device management. It ensures that different applications and users can access hardware resources in a controlled and secure manner.

## 2. Types of Operating Systems

### I. **Batch Operating System**

- Processes jobs in batches without user interaction during processing.
- Jobs are collected, grouped, and processed sequentially.
- Example: Early IBM OS systems.

### II. **Time-Sharing Operating System**

- Allows multiple users to share system resources simultaneously.
- Employs time slices to switch between users/processes, giving the impression of multitasking.
- Example: UNIX.

### III. **Distributed Operating System**

- Manages a group of independent computers as a single system, providing distributed computing capabilities.
- Allows resources and processing to be shared across networked machines.
- Example: Googleâ€™s Borg system.

### IV. **Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)**

- Designed to process data as it comes in, with strict time constraints.
- Used in systems where timely processing is critical, such as embedded systems.
- Example: VxWorks, FreeRTOS.

### V. **Network Operating System (NOS)**

- Provides networking capabilities like file sharing, printer access, and data exchange.
- Often used in environments where computers need to communicate and share resources.
- Example: Windows Server, Novell NetWare.

### VI. **Mobile Operating System**

- Specifically designed for mobile devices, optimized for touch inputs and mobile-specific hardware.
- Example: Android, iOS.

### VII. **Embedded Operating System**

- Used in specialized devices like ATMs, washing machines, and medical equipment.
- Usually, lightweight and dedicated to specific functions.
- Example: Embedded Linux, Windows Embedded.
